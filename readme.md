# API

``` javascript

  var client1 = MuxDmx(),
      client2 = MuxDmx(),
      stream1 = client1.stream(new Buffer([0])),
      stream2 = client2.stream(new Buffer([0])),

  client1.pipe(client2).pipe(client1);

  stream1.on('data', function (data) {
    console.log(data.toString('utf8')); // Pong
  });

  stream2.on('data', function (data) {
    console.log(data.toString('utf8')); // Ping
  });

  stream1.write(new Buffer('Ping'));
  stream2.write(new Buffer('Pong'));

```

## MuxDmx()

* Return `Duplex` MuxDmx Stream

## instance.stream(id)

* id `Buffer`
* Return `Duplex` Multiplexed Duplex Stream

The id is sent down the wire to distinguish the stream on the other side. The smaller the id, the smaller the framing sent.
